/**
 * you have to invoke or call the function using the function name, 
 * followed by parentheses with any arguments that are passed into it. 
 * Functions are like machines. You can build the machine, 
 * but it won't do anything unless you also turn it on. 
 * 
 * Parameters vs. Arguments
 * Parameters => variable name and appears in the function declaration
 * Arguments => argument is always going to be a value and will always appear in the code when the function is called or invoked.
 * 
 * If you don't explicitly define a return value, the function will return undefined by default.
